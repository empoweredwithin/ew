    </ol>

    <h2>ANSWERS:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>To become the President of India, Jatin needs to satisfy the following qualifications:
            <ul>
                <li>He must be a citizen of India.</li>
                <li>He must be at least 35 years old.</li>
                <li>He must be qualified to be a member of the Lok Sabha (House of the People), meaning he must meet the eligibility criteria for contesting a Lok Sabha election.</li>
                <li>He must not hold any office of profit under the Government of India or the Government of any State etc.</li>
            </ul>
            Once elected, the President of India serves a term of five years. However, the President can be re-elected for multiple terms. Additionally, the President may resign before the completion of the term or be removed by impeachment for violation of the Constitution.
        </li>
        <li>The president is elected indirectly by the members of an electoral college consisting of,
            <ol type="a">
                <li>The elected members of both the houses of the parliament.</li>
                <li>The elected members of the legislative assemblies of the states, including national capital territory of Delhi and the Union Territory of Puducherry.</li>
            </ol>
            The President is elected by the system of proportional representation by the means of Single Transferrable Vote.
        </li>
        <li>
            <ul>
                <li>If the president was to be elected directly by the people, he could become a rival center of power to the Council of Ministers.</li>
                <li>This would be against the parliamentary system with ministerial responsibility.</li>
                <li>Since one parliament house dominates the other in an election, if the president were to be elected directly by the people, he would be a member of the Union Parliament, like the prime minister.</li>
                <li>The president is elected by an electoral college. In India, electoral College consists of the elected members of the two houses of the parliaments and the legislative assemblies of the states.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>When President is to be impeached for violation of the constitution,
            <ul>
                <li>A resolution is passed by a majority of not less than two thirds of the total membership of the house.</li>
                <li>When a charge has been so preferred by either house of the parliament, the other house will investigate the charge, and the president has the right to appear and to be represented at such an investigation.</li>
                <li>As a result of the investigation, a resolution is passed by a majority of not less than two thirds of the total membership of the house by which a resolution will have effect of removing the president from his office.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li>There are three emergencies that the president can proclaim.
            <ul>
                <li>National or General Emergency

                        <li>In case of a danger of foreign aggression or danger to the peace and security of the country because of a civil war, insurgency of or any other such cause.</li>

                </li>
                <li>Breakdown of constitutional missionary
                    <ul>
                        <li>The constitutional machinery in a state has broken down, or there's a deadlock because of political uncertainties.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Financial emergency
                    <ul>
                        <li>A setback to the financial stability or credit feasibility of the country is likely to occur, or has occurred.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <ol type="a">
                <li>When the state government is unable to function according to the provisions of the Constitution. This could be due to a breakdown in law and order, inability to form a government, or political instability.<br>
                It is referred to as President's Rule because, upon the declaration of such an emergency, the state's executive powers are transferred to the President of India, who governs the state through the Governor, effectively replacing the elected government.</li>
                <li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Initial Duration: Once proclaimed, the President's Rule lasts for 6 months.</li>
                        <li>Extension: It can be extended up to a maximum of 3 years with the approval of both houses of Parliament every 6 months.</li>
                        <li>However, the emergency can be extended beyond 1 year if the following two conditions are met:
                            <ul>
                                <li>National Emergency: A National Emergency must be in operation in the whole or any part of India.</li>
                                <li>Election Commission's Certification: The Election Commission of India must certify that general elections to the Legislative Assembly of the state cannot be held.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>When President's Rule is imposed:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Executive Powers: The state's Council of Ministers is dismissed, and the executive powers of the state are taken over by the President, who acts through the Governor.</li>
                        <li>Legislative Powers: The state legislative assembly is either suspended or dissolved, and Parliament assumes the legislative functions of the state.</li>
                        <li>Administrative Control: The Union Government directly controls the administration of the state through the Governor.</li>
                    </ul>
                    This effectively places the state under direct control of the central government until the normal constitutional machinery is restored.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
            <ul>
                <li>The Vice President is the ex-officio Chairman of the Rajya Sabha, the upper house of Parliament.</li>
                <li>As Chairman, the Vice President presides over its sessions, ensures order, and conducts the proceedings of the Rajya Sabha.</li>
                <li>The Vice President can cast a deciding vote in case of a tie in the Rajya Sabha but cannot vote otherwise.</li>
                <li>If the office of the President of India becomes vacant due to death, resignation, removal, or any other reason, the Vice President acts as the President until a new President is elected.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
