    <h2>Answers:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>The factors responsible for the formation of Muslim league are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Muslims became bitter enemies of the British after they established their supremacy in India after dethroning Mughal rulers, who were the followers of Islam.</li>
                <li>The British policy of 'divide and rule' affected the Muslims and increased their hatred towards Hindus.</li>
                <li>Muslims were relatively backward and were in a disadvantage.</li>
                <li>Negative influence of Principal Beck on Sir Sayyid Ahmed Khan, who said, that Anglo-Muslim unity was possible but Hindu-Muslim unity was not possible.</li>
                <li>The manner in which Indian history was interpreted in those days contributed to the growth of communal thinking among the Hindus and Muslims.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Muslims demanded:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Representation of Muslims in elected bodies on the basis of their political importance and not on their numerical strength</li>
                <li>Separate electoral constituencies for the Muslims in the provincial council and the Imperial Legislative Council.</li>
                <li>Preference to be given to Muslims while nominating members of the Viceroy's Council.</li>
                <li>Reservation of seats for Muslims in the state services.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>The events that led to the formation of Muslim league are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The MAO Association was formed in 1893 to promote support for the British and to prevent Muslims from participating in any political movement.</li>
                <li>Partition of Bengal in 1905 created a wedge between the Hindus and Muslims.</li>
                <li>Lord Minto in 1906 assured Muslims that their political rights would be safeguarded.</li>
                <li>The Mohammedan Educational Conference was held at Dhaka, and it accepted the proposal to form a central organization for the Muslims.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>The objectives of league were laid down as follows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>To promote, among the Muslims of India, support for the British government.</li>
                <li>To safeguard the political rights and interests of the Muslims.</li>
                <li>To prevent rise of feelings of hostility between the Muslims of India and other communities.</li>
                <li>To present the needs and aspirations of the Muslims to the government.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Significance of Lucknow Pact 1916:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The join scheme symbolized Hindu-Muslim unity. The Congress compromised and accepted the scheme of separate electorates for Muslims, and The Muslim league accepted the principles of elections and the majority rule.</li>
                <li>The split that happened between the early and the assertive nationalists in the year 1907, was again tied up in 1916. As a result, Congress was strengthened.</li>
                <li>Since the Hindu-Muslim and the early-assertive nationalists' bond was strengthened, it put a lot of pressure on the government.</li>
                <li>The government therefore felt it necessary to pacify the Indians by promising gradual development of self-government institutions in India.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

            <p>The Lucknow Pact was an agreement reached in 1916 between the Indian National Congress (INC) and the All-India Muslim League. It marked a significant moment in India's struggle for independence, as it brought the two major political groups together to present a united front against British colonial rule.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The India Council in London, which controlled Indian affairs, was to be abolished.</li>
                <li>The Pact introduced separate electorates for Muslims</li>
                <li>The Pact provided for adequate and separate representation of Muslims in governance.</li>
                <li>Separation of judiciary from the executive.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li>It did not involve the masses.</li>
                <li>It emphasized the separate political existence for Hindus and Muslims.</li>
                <li>It did not resolve the deadlock between the executive and the legislatures.</li>
                <li>It provided for a 'communal veto' in legislation.</li>
                <li>The government's repressive policy, followed by the declaration of August 1917.</li>
