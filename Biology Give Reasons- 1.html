    <h2>Answers</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <div class="answer">Meiosis is called reductional division because it reduces the chromosome number by half, creating four haploid cells from a diploid cell. This ensures that the gametes produced during sexual reproduction maintain the species-specific chromosome number.</div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div class="answer">Color blindness and hemophilia occur more frequently in men because they are X-linked recessive disorders. Males have only one X chromosome (XY), so a single copy of the defective allele on the X chromosome causes the disorder, while females (XX) would require two copies of the defective gene.</div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div class="answer">A heterozygous recessive is not possible because the term "heterozygous" refers to having one dominant and one recessive allele. A recessive trait can only be expressed if the individual is homozygous recessive (has two copies of the recessive allele).</div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div class="answer">Grapes burst when soaked in water due to endosmosis. Water enters the cells of the grapes, increasing turgor pressure within the cells, which causes the outer skin to rupture.</div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div class="answer">Marine fish placed in freshwater undergo endosmosis. The cells of the fish are hypertonic to the freshwater, causing water to flow into the cells, leading to swelling and bursting due to the lack of osmoregulatory adaptation.</div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div class="answer">Frogs are not seen in seawater because they are osmoregulatory freshwater animals. The high salt concentration in seawater causes exosmosis, leading to dehydration, making survival in saline environments impossible for frogs.</div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div class="answer">Pickles and jams resist spoilage due to their high osmotic pressure, created by sugar or salt. This hypertonic environment causes exosmosis in microbial cells, preventing their growth and proliferation.</div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div class="answer">Sprinkling common salt on grass causes exosmosis in plant cells. Water is drawn out of the cells, leading to plasmolysis, which kills the grass at the spot where the salt is applied.</div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div class="answer">When a plant is uprooted from soil, it wilts due to the loss of water absorption from the roots. Without water, the cells lose turgor pressure, leading to flaccidity and wilting of the plant.</div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div class="answer">Potato cubes placed in water undergo endosmosis, where water enters the cells, increasing their turgor pressure. This causes the cells to become firm and the cubes to swell.</div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div class="answer">Weeds can be destroyed by sprinkling salt, which creates a hypertonic environment. This causes exosmosis, leading to plasmolysis in the plant cells, ultimately killing the weeds.</div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div class="answer">Plants growing on walls cause cracks because the roots exert mechanical pressure as they grow. The roots penetrate small crevices, and as they expand, they weaken the structure, leading to cracks.</div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div class="answer">Some plants exhibit wilting at noon due to high transpiration rates caused by intense sunlight. Even with sufficient water in the soil, the rate of water loss through stomata exceeds the rate of water uptake, temporarily reducing turgor pressure.</div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div class="answer">Forests contribute to increased rainfall due to the process of transpiration, where water vapor is released into the atmosphere. This increases local humidity, enhancing cloud formation and precipitation.</div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div class="answer">Transpiration rates are higher on a windy day because wind reduces the boundary layer of moist air around leaves. This increases the water vapor gradient, accelerating water loss through stomata.</div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div class="answer">Placing a plant in the dark before a photosynthesis experiment depletes the starch stored in the leaves. This ensures that any starch observed afterward is a result of photosynthesis occurring during the experiment.</div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div class="answer">Sleeping in a closed room with a burning furnace is dangerous because it can lead to carbon monoxide poisoning. Carbon monoxide binds with hemoglobin more effectively than oxygen, reducing oxygen delivery to tissues and potentially causing death.</div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div class="answer">Sunflower heads follow the sun from East to West due to heliotropism, a movement driven by differential growth rates in the stem. This allows the plant to maximize light absorption for photosynthesis throughout the day.</div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div class="answer">We urinate less in summer than in winter because the body loses more water through sweating. The urine becomes more concentrated as the kidneys conserve water to maintain proper hydration levels.</div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div class="answer">Excretion is a vital process for eliminating metabolic waste products such as urea, carbon dioxide, and excess salts. This prevents the buildup of toxic substances in the body, maintaining homeostasis.</div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div class="answer">Adrenaline is known as the emergency hormone because it triggers the fight-or-flight response. It increases heart rate, dilates airways, and boosts glucose availability, preparing the body to respond to stressful situations.</div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div class="answer">The pituitary gland is called the master gland because it regulates the activity of other endocrine glands. It secretes hormones like ACTH, TSH, and GH, which control growth, metabolism, and reproductive functions.</div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div class="answer">People in low Himalayan regions often suffer from goitre due to iodine deficiency. The iodine-poor soil and water in these areas lead to inadequate thyroid hormone production, causing thyroid gland enlargement (goitre).</div>
