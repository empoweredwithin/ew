    <h2>Answers:</h2>

    <div class="answer">
        <p>1. The immediate cause of the First War of Independence was the introduction of the Enfield rifle. The loading process of the Enfield rifle involved bringing the cartridge to the mouth and biting off the top greased paper with the teeth.</p>
        <p>In January 1857, there was a rumor in the Bengal regiments that the greased cartridge had the fat of cow or pig. The sepoys were now convinced that the introduction of greased cartridges was a deliberate move to defile Hindu and Muslim religions. So, the soldiers refused to use these cartridges and staged an uprising when they were forced to use them.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="answer">
        <p>2. - The movement did not have common plans of military action or a centralized leadership. The uprisings in different parts of the country were completely uncoordinated.</p>
        <p>- The British Empire had far superior resources in terms of men, money, and materials to the Indian.</p>
        <p>- Some of the rulers of the Indian States and the big zamindars refused to join the movement.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="answer">
        <p>3. Before the First War of Independence in 1857, revolts against British rule were local and scattered. These revolts were generally isolated and easily suppressed by the British. According to some prominent people then, the uprising began as a fight for religion and ended as a war of independence, which was not planned beforehand.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="answer">
        <p>4. It is generally hailed as the 'First War of Independence', because:</p>
        <p>- It was the first mass uprising in which all the sections of Indian society participated against a common enemy, i.e. the British.</p>
        <p>- It paved the way for the rise of modern national movement. The sacrifices made by Laxmi Bai, Nana Saheb and Mangal Pandey served as a source of inspiration to the leaders and people to fight for the independence of India from the British rule.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="answer">
        <p>5. The British expanded their territorial power in India through several strategies, three of which include:</p>
        <p>- Doctrine of Lapse: This policy, introduced by Lord Dalhousie, allowed the British to annex any princely state where the ruler died without a natural heir. Notable annexations under this policy include Satara, Jhansi, and Nagpur.</p>
        <p>- Subsidiary Alliance: Introduced by Lord Wellesley, this policy required Indian rulers to accept British forces in their territories and pay for their maintenance. In return, the British offered protection against external threats. This effectively made the Indian states dependent on the British and paved the way for their control.</p>
        <p>- Direct Military Conquest: The British used their superior military strength to defeat Indian rulers and annex their territories. Key examples include the Anglo-Mysore Wars, the Anglo-Maratha Wars, and the Anglo-Sikh Wars, which resulted in the annexation of large parts of India.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="answer">
        <p>6. The Subsidiary Alliance was introduced by Lord Wellesley. It was an agreement between the British East India Company and the Indian Princely States by virtue of these states lost their sovereignty to the British. Under this system, the Indian rulers had to agree on certain grounds:</p>
        <p>- Accept the British as the supreme power.</p>
        <p>- Surrender their foreign relations and only get into alliance with the East India Company.</p>
        <p>- Accept a British resident at their headquarters</p>
        <p>- Agree to maintain British troops at their own cost</p>
        <p>- Virtually lose their independence</p>
    </div>

    <div class="answer">
        <p>7. The name of the Mughal King was removed from the coins minted by the company.</p>
        <p>- In 1849, Lord Dalhousie announced that successors of Bahadur Shah Zafar would not be permitted to use the Red Fort as their palace, but should shift to a place near the Qutub Minar.</p>
        <p>- In 1856, Lord Canning announced that after the death of Bahadur Shah Zafar, his successors would not be allowed to use imperial titles with their names and will be known as mere princes.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="answer">
        <p>8. People had mixed feelings about modern innovations like railways and telegraph poles:</p>
        <p>i) Railways:</p>
        <p>- Many feared that train travel would disrupt their religious practices and traditional social structures.</p>
        <p>- They also worried that railways would strengthen British control and facilitate easier troop movements.</p>
        <p>ii) Telegraph Poles:</p>
        <p>- Some viewed telegraph poles with superstition, believing they will be used to hang and execute the people who were against the British Government.</p>
        <p>These concerns led to skepticism and resistance toward these technological advancements.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="answer">
        <p>9. The economic causes for the 1857 Revolt (First War of Independence) were:</p>
        <p>- Land Revenue Policies: The British introduced new land revenue systems that increased taxes and often led to land confiscation when farmers couldn't pay. This economic burden fueled discontent among peasants and landlords alike.</p>
        <p>- Economic Exploitation: The British East India Company's monopoly over trade and industries marginalized Indian merchants and artisans, causing widespread economic hardship and resentment.</p>
        <p>- Disruption of Traditional Industries: British policies favored imported goods over local products, leading to the decline of traditional industries like textiles. This economic downturn affected livelihoods and further exacerbated tensions against British rule.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="answer">
        <p>10. Absentee sovereignty of the British means that they ruled India from afar. Decision-making and ultimate authority rested with authorities in Britain, even though there were British officials present in India to manage day-to-day affairs.</p>

    <div class="question">c) Any four Political Causes.</div>

    <h2>Answers:</h2>

    <div class="answer">
        <p>1.</p>
        <p>a) Reforms in Administrative Set-Up:</p>
        <p>- End of the East India Company Rule: The British Crown took over direct control of India from the East India Company. This ended the Company's commercial interests and established a formal British Raj.</p>
        <p>- Centralization of Authority: The administrative structure was centralized under the British Crown, with the Viceroy of India appointed to represent the monarch. Lord canning was the first viceroy under this.</p>
        <p>- Creation of Legislative Bodies: The Indian Councils Act of 1861 expanded the legislative councils, allowing some Indian participation in governance, although in a limited capacity initially.</p>

        <p>b) Changes in the army:</p>
        <p>- The strength of the European Troops was increased. The general principal adopted was that the number of Indian sepoys should not exceed twice that of the European Troops.</p>
        <p>- European Troops were kept in key geographical positions</p>
        <p>- Sophisticated weapons and ammunition were never placed under the charge of the Indians.</p>

        <p>c) Queen's Proclamation:</p>
        <p>- Assumption of Direct Rule: Queen Victoria announced that henceforth, the governance of India would be directly under the control of the British Crown. This ended the era of the East India Company's rule and established the British Raj, with the British government assuming direct responsibility for India's administration.</p>
        <p>- Promises of Equality and Justice: The Proclamation assured Indians of fair treatment under British law and justice. It pledged to respect Indian customs, religions, and traditions, aiming to allay fears and build trust among the Indian population after the harsh reprisals that followed the revolt.</p>
        <p>- Offer of Opportunities for Indians: Queen Victoria's government promised that qualified Indians would be considered for employment in the civil service and other positions within the administration. This was an attempt to co-opt a segment of the Indian elite into supporting British rule and to create a more stable governing structure.</p>
        <p>- Restoration of Peace and Order: The Proclamation emphasized the desire of the British government to restore peace and order in India after the turmoil of the revolt. It sought to reassure the Indian populace that stability and progress would follow under British rule.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="answer">
        <p>2. The 1857 Revolt (First War of Independence) saw widespread participation due to various socio-religious, military, and political causes:</p>

        <p>a) Socio-Religious Causes:</p>
        <p>- Religious Discontent:</p>
        <p>Greased Cartridge Issue: The introduction of greased cartridges rumored to be coated with animal fat (cow and pig) offended both Hindu and Muslim sepoys, who viewed it as a deliberate attempt to defile their religious beliefs.</p>
        <p>Interference in Religious Practices: British attempts to interfere with traditional customs and practices, such as through missionary activities and social reforms, alienated conservative elements in Indian society.</p>
        <p>- Social Discrimination:</p>
        <p>Caste-Based Grievances: Policies and practices that undermined traditional caste hierarchies and customs were perceived as a threat to social order and identity.</p>
        <p>Economic Exploitation: British economic policies led to widespread poverty and indebtedness among peasants and artisans, exacerbating social tensions.</p>

        <p>b) Military Causes:</p>
        <p>- Sepoy Discontent:</p>
        <p>Sepoy Grievances: Sepoys faced low pay, harsh discipline, and poor living conditions. They were also dissatisfied with the lack of opportunities for promotion and perceived discrimination in terms of allowances and privileges.</p>
        <p>Mismanagement and Neglect: British officers often displayed cultural insensitivity and failed to understand or address the concerns of Indian soldiers, leading to growing discontent and mistrust.</p>
        <p>General Service Enlistment act: The General Service Enlistment Act of 1856 required Indian soldiers in the army to serve overseas if needed. But according to their religious belief of the Brahmins, it is a taboo for them to cross the seas. This, along with other grievances, sparked the 1857 Revolt against British rule in India.</p>

        <p>c) Political Causes:</p>
        <p>- Doctrine of Lapse and Annexations:</p>
        <p>Annexation Policies: The British annexation of Indian princely states under the Doctrine of Lapse, which denied inheritance to adopted heirs, triggered resentment among Indian rulers and their subjects. Jhansi was annexed under this policy.</p>

        <p>- Disrespect shown to Bahadur Shah Zafar:</p>
        <p>The name of the Mughal King was removed from the coins minted by the company.</p>
        <p>In 1849, Lord Dalhousie announced that successors of Bahadur Shah Zafar would not be permitted to use the Red Fort as their palace, but should shift to a place near the Qutub Minar.</p>
        <p>In 1856, Lord Canning announced that after the death of Bahadur Shah Zafar, his successors would not be allowed to use imperial titles with their names and will be known as mere princes.</p>

        <p>- By Subsidiary Alliance:</p>
        <p>This policy required Indian rulers to accept British forces in their territories and pay for their maintenance. In return, the British offered protection against external threats. This effectively made the Indian states dependent on the British and paved the way for their control.</p>

        <p>-Absentee Sovereignty of British:</p>
        <p>Absentee sovereignty of the British means that they ruled India from afar. Decision-making and ultimate authority rested with authorities in Britain, even though there were British officials present in India to manage day-to-day affairs.</p>
